Contains various algorithms and small programs created using Rust.

## List

1. Binary search
2. Guessing game
3. Factorial recursion
4. Pallindrome recursion
5. Power of recursion
6. Insertion sort
7. Selection sort
8. Merge sort
9. Quick sort

## TODO

1. Standardize the way the programs accept user input
2. Add tests.

## Disclaimer

I make no claims to the quality of the code. The code has been written to the best of my knowledge (pretty low in Rust). You might probably find much better code elsewhere. Feel free to look around critique the code.
